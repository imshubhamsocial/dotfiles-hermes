  Mythos-Harness presents a four-phase "finish-first" agent loop optimized for high-reasoning models (Claude Opus 4.7). It structures the software lifecycle into an assembly line where the agent plans, executes, verifies against strict constraints, and ships finished artifacts autonomously without babysitting or manual intervention.

- **Four-Phase "Finish-First" Lifecycle**:
  1. **Plan Phase**:
     - Decomposes high-level natural language objectives into modular, actionable sub-tasks.
     - Maps explicit input/output formats, dependencies, and strict pass/fail success criteria per task.
  2. **Execute Phase**:
     - Executes tasks in dependency order with full session context retention.
     - Captures operational metrics, timestamps, filesystem mutations, and API calls.
  3. **Verify Phase & Remediation Loop (Verification Grid)**:
     - Automated validation including:
       - **Structure Check**: File and folder layout validation against required blueprints.
       - **Syntax Lint**: Language-specific static analysis and syntax validation.
       - **Type Coherence**: Variable types and function signatures matched against declarations.
       - **Test Execution**: Unit test execution and pass/fail gate checks.
       - **Performance Thresholds**: Execution time and memory profiling to detect outliers.
     - **Remediation Loop**: On test or constraint failure, detailed error diagnostics are routed into an automated re-execution fix cycle up to a defined retry limit.
  4. **Ship Phase**:
     - Bundles verified outputs into deliverables: Git commits, zip archives, staging deployments, webhooks, or notification channels.

- **System Architecture**:
  - **Orchestrator**: Coordinates phases, handles state progression, and drives error recovery.
  - **Context Engine**: Maintains persistent working memory across sessions (local filesystem, Redis, PostgreSQL) to allow seamless resumption of interrupted workflows without re-planning.
  - **Verification Grid**: Modular, extensible plugin architecture (`VerificationModule` subclasses) for domain-specific contract testing.
  - **Pipeline Adapter**: Adapts completed artifacts into external delivery formats (Git, S3, webhooks).
